With over 10 years of hands-on experience, I've helped companies in three different countries — The Dominican Republic, France, and The United States — grow their business and improve the quality of their offerings. I have worked in the e-commerce, education, finance, social network, and service sectors, in roles that go from "bug hunter" to technical lead, for companies of all sizes. Here are some of the things that I have achieved during my career:

- Led successful migrations of high-traffic web applications in LAMP/LEMP environments
- Led a team in the development of a high-traffic REST-compliant API
- Led a team in the development of multiple professional-grade WordPress plugins
- Gave a talk on the best practices when building REST APIs in one of the most prestigious universities in Santiago, Dominican Republic
- Built scalable and cost-effective serverless solutions on Amazon Web Services using multiple languages
- Refactored legacy applications, introducing design patterns and adding test suites
- Worked on both, monolith and microservice architectures, leveraging different stacks and technologies

Here are some of the things I'm passionate about:

- Automation
- Cloud computing
